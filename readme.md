# Cathal Garvey's Curriculum Vitae
## About
Right now, I'm seeking either employment or funding to operate as full-time manager
at [Cork Biomakerspace](http://www.indiebiotech.com/?p=248) and make great things
happen in Cork City. If either appeals to you, get in touch!

Included are two CVs, as I was advised to partition my work in Synthetic Biology
from my Software work so as not to confuse potential employers. They have different
foci, naturally, but still overlap significantly.

If you just like the stuff I do or have done, and would like to help me retain the
freedom to keep making great things, I appreciate support via Gittip:
